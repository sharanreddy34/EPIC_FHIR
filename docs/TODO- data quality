Codebase Structure and Integration Plan
[✓] Define overall module structure for `epic-fhir-integration` (e.g., `client/`, `transformers/`, `validators/`, `utils/`, `schemas/`, `config/`)
[✓] Designate location for FHIR resource schema definitions (e.g., `epic-fhir-integration/schemas/` or `epic-fhir-integration/config/schemas/`)
[✓] Integrate schema validation into the data parsing pipeline, loading schemas from their defined location.
[✓] Determine placement for transformation logic (e.g., `epic-fhir-integration/transformers/`)
[✓] Integrate `resolve_references` method into `custom_fhir_client.py` or a new `epic-fhir-integration/fhir_utils.py` module.
[✓] Place data validation functions in a dedicated module (e.g., `epic-fhir-integration/validators/data_validators.py`).
[✓] Integrate validation rules into the transformation pipeline, calling the dedicated validation module.
[✓] Consolidate utility functions (e.g., `extract_with_fallback`, date parsers, reference extractors) into `epic-fhir-integration/utils/`.
[✓] Organize test files within `epic-fhir-integration/tests/` using subdirectories (e.g., `tests/unit/`, `tests/integration/`, `tests/fixtures/`).
[✓] Implement a centralized configuration system (e.g., using `epic-fhir-integration/config.py` or YAML/JSON files in `epic-fhir-integration/config/`) for API endpoints, schema paths, pagination limits, and other parameters.
[✓] Establish a consistent logging framework and configuration (e.g., a `logging_config.py` or setup within the main application entry point) to be used across all modules.
