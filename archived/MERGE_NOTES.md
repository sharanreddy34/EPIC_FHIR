# Epic FHIR Integration Merge Notes

## Overview
This document describes the merge of two FHIR integration codebases:
- `epic_fhir_integration` (original folder)
- `epic-fhir-integration` (hyphenated, more mature project)

The merge combined unique functionality from the original project into the more mature codebase structure.

## Merged Components
The following components were integrated from the original codebase:

1. **Datascience Module** 
   - Added missing datascience functionality 
   - Integrated with existing analytics capabilities

2. **Validation Module**
   - Added validation functionality
   - Merged with existing validation capabilities

3. **Profiles Module**
   - Added FHIR profile definitions for Epic
   - Includes FSH (FHIR Shorthand) definitions

4. **CLI Components**
   - Added datascience_commands.py
   - Added validation_commands.py
   - Updated CLI entry points in pyproject.toml

## Structure
The merged codebase maintains the structure of the `epic-fhir-integration` project while incorporating the functionality from `epic_fhir_integration`.

## Next Steps
- Run comprehensive tests to ensure all functionality works correctly
- Validate the merged code against Epic FHIR APIs
- Document the new capabilities in the main project README
- Consider creating more detailed documentation for the datascience and validation modules

The original `epic_fhir_integration` folder has been archived to `archived/epic_fhir_integration_original` for reference.
