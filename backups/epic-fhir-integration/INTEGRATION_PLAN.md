- [x] Identify current FHIR processing patterns
- [x] Document existing FHIRPath usage

**Findings:**
- Modular structure with auth, cli, config, extract, io, metrics, schemas, security, transform, and utils components
- FHIRPath usage pattern implemented through `fhirpathpy` wrapper class
- Main dependencies include fhir.resources, fhirpathpy, pandas, pyspark, delta-spark, and dask

### 1.2 Review Current FHIRPath Implementation
- [x] Audit all uses of fhirpathpy in the codebase
- [x] Identify complex data extraction patterns that could benefit from enhanced tools
- [x] Document performance bottlenecks in current implementation

**Findings:**
- Current implementation in `fhirpath_extractor.py` uses `fhirpathpy` library
- Common extraction patterns include value extraction, existence checking, filtering collections, navigating references, and handling polymorphic fields
- Bottlenecks include lack of caching/optimization, limited FHIRPath spec implementation, and inefficient batch processing

### 1.3 Analytics Capabilities Assessment
- [x] Identify current analytics capabilities
- [x] Document reporting requirements not currently met
- [x] Map population-level analytics use cases

**Findings:**
- Current support for basic aggregation, individual resource processing, and limited cross-resource analysis

### 1.4 Data Science Workflow Assessment
- [x] Review current data transformation patterns
- [x] Identify machine learning or statistical analysis needs
- [x] Document current ETL processes for FHIR data

**Findings:**
- ETL process follows Extract (from Epic APIs), Transform, and Load pattern
- Limitations include lack of streamlined dataset creation, manual feature extraction, no standardized cohort definition, and custom ML pipeline integration
- Improvement opportunities identified for standardized dataset creation, simplified cohort management, integrated feature extraction, and better longitudinal data handling

### 1.5 Development Environment Testing
- [x] Verify Java availability for Pathling (minimum version required, installation guide)
